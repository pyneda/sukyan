title: ACME Challenge Directory Detected
description: |
  The ACME (Automatic Certificate Management Environment) challenge directory is accessible. This directory is used by Let's Encrypt and other certificate authorities for domain validation.

  While the directory itself is not sensitive, its presence indicates:
  - The domain uses automated SSL/TLS certificate management
  - The web server is configured to serve challenge responses
  - Potential for certificate management issues if misconfigured

  Old challenge tokens left in this directory could indicate stale configurations.
remediation: |
  Review the ACME challenge configuration:
  - Ensure old challenge files are cleaned up after certificate issuance
  - Verify the certificate renewal process is working correctly
  - Consider using DNS-01 challenges for internal services
  - Monitor certificate expiration dates
