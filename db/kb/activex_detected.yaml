title: ActiveX Controls Usage Detected
description: |
  The application appears to be using ActiveX controls, which is a deprecated technology
  primarily associated with Internet Explorer. ActiveX controls are no longer supported
  by modern web browsers and pose significant security risks. These controls had extensive
  access to the Windows operating system and were a common attack vector for malware.
  With Internet Explorer's end-of-life on June 15, 2022, continued use of ActiveX
  creates both security vulnerabilities and severe functionality issues.
remediation: |
  To address this security concern:
  1. Identify all ActiveX controls and functionality in your application
  2. Plan a migration strategy to modern web technologies:
     - Replace ActiveX controls with standard HTML5 elements and JavaScript
     - Use modern APIs for file operations and system interactions
     - Implement secure alternatives for any custom functionality
     - Consider Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) for advanced features
     - Use WebAssembly for performance-critical components
  3. Remove all ActiveX-related code including:
     - Object/Embed tags with ClassIDs
     - ActiveXObject JavaScript calls
     - .cab and .ocx files
  4. Update any documentation that references ActiveX functionality
  5. Implement user notifications about technology changes if necessary
  6. Consider implementing feature detection for graceful fallbacks
