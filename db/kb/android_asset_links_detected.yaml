title: Android App Links Configuration Detected
description: |
  An Android Asset Links file (assetlinks.json) has been discovered at the well-known location. This file is used by Android to establish a trust relationship between an app and a website for App Links (deep linking).

  The file contains:
  - Package names of Android apps trusted by this domain
  - SHA256 certificate fingerprints for app verification
  - Namespace and relation declarations

  While this is typically intended to be public, it reveals information about mobile applications associated with the domain.
remediation: |
  Review the assetlinks.json file to ensure:
  - Only intended applications are listed
  - Certificate fingerprints are correct and up-to-date
  - The file doesn't expose internal or development application configurations
  - Consider if all listed apps should be publicly associated with this domain
