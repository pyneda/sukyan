title: Apple App Site Association Detected
description: |
  An Apple App Site Association (AASA) file has been discovered. This file is used by iOS/macOS to establish Universal Links, allowing apps to open specific URLs directly.

  The file may contain:
  - App identifiers (team ID and bundle ID)
  - URL path patterns for deep linking
  - Webcredentials configuration for password AutoFill
  - App Clip configurations

  While intended to be public, this reveals mobile application configurations and URL routing logic.

  Review the apple-app-site-association file to ensure:
  - Only production app identifiers are listed
  - URL patterns don't expose sensitive endpoints
  - The file is properly formatted and validated
  - Webcredentials are correctly configured if used
