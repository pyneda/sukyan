title: ASP.NET Trace Viewer Exposed
description: |
  The application has ASP.NET tracing enabled and publicly accessible through trace.axd.
  Trace viewing allows anyone to see detailed information about recent requests including
  server variables, cookies, session state, application variables, request/response headers,
  and form data. This can expose sensitive information and implementation details that
  could aid an attacker.
remediation: |
  To fix this security issue:
  1. Disable trace viewing in production by setting trace="false" in the Web.config file:
     <configuration>
       <system.web>
         <trace enabled="false" localOnly="true" />
       </system.web>
     </configuration>
  2. If tracing is required, ensure it's only accessible locally by setting localOnly="true"
  3. Consider using logging frameworks or APM tools instead of ASP.NET tracing in production
  4. Implement proper authentication if trace viewing must be accessible remotely
