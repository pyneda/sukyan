title: Backup File Detected
description: |
  A backup or temporary file has been discovered that may contain sensitive configuration or source code. These files are often created by text editors, version control systems, or administrators and should not be publicly accessible.

  Common backup file patterns include:
  - .bak, .old, .backup extensions
  - ~ suffix (vim, emacs backups)
  - .swp, .swo files (vim swap files)
  - Copy of files with timestamps

  These files may contain:
  - Configuration file contents with credentials
  - Source code revealing application logic
  - Database connection strings
  - API keys and secrets
remediation: |
  Remove or restrict access to backup files:
  - Delete unnecessary backup files from production servers
  - Configure web server to deny access to common backup extensions
  - Use .htaccess or nginx rules to block .bak, .old, .backup, ~ files
  - Implement file monitoring to detect new backup files
  - Review deployment processes to prevent backup file creation in production
