title: Cache Storage Usage Detection Report
description: This report documents the detection of Cache Storage usage on specific pages of the application.
  Cache Storage is part of the Service Worker API and allows web applications to store and manage
  resources, such as files and data, in an efficient, versioned cache. Utilizing Cache Storage
  can significantly enhance performance by reducing load times and providing offline content access.
  However, improper management of cache storage can lead to security vulnerabilities, such as stale
  or sensitive data being inadvertently cached.
remediation: While this report is primarily for informational purposes, it is recommended to periodically review
  the contents and management strategies of cache storage to ensure data integrity and security.
  Developers should implement and enforce policies for cache expiration and data sanitation to prevent
  leakage of sensitive information. Regular security audits should be performed to ensure that cached
  data does not expose the application to additional attack vectors.
