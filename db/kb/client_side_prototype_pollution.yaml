title: Client-Side Prototype Pollution Detected
description:
  The application appears to be vulnerable to Client-Side Prototype Pollution
  (CSPP) attacks. This vulnerability occurs when the application processes user-supplied
  input with the JavaScript function `Object.assign()`, or uses it to clone an object.
  An attacker can inject properties into object prototypes, potentially leading to
  a variety of impacts, including denial-of-service, alteration of script behavior,
  or cross-site scripting (XSS) if the polluted properties are used in a DOM context.
remediation:
  To mitigate this vulnerability, avoid using the `Object.assign()` function
  with user-supplied input. If user input must be used, ensure it is thoroughly validated
  and sanitized first. Implement proper input validation and sanitization procedures.
  Also, be aware of how your client-side code handles object properties and ensure
  that all code which reads from object properties handles unexpected values correctly.
