code: crlf_injection
title: CRLF Injection Detected
description: The application appears to be vulnerable to CRLF (Carriage Return Line
  Feed) injection attacks. This vulnerability occurs when the application does not
  properly sanitize user-supplied input that is then used in HTTP headers. An attacker
  can exploit this vulnerability to manipulate HTTP headers and control the HTTP response
  body, potentially leading to HTTP response splitting, session hijacking, cross-site
  scripting (XSS) attacks, or other injection attacks.
remediation: To mitigate this vulnerability, sanitize and validate all user-supplied
  inputs that are incorporated into HTTP headers. Remove or escape CRLF sequences
  and other control characters. Use allowlists of acceptable inputs, rather than denylists
  of bad inputs. In addition, configure your web server to ignore or reject HTTP headers
  that contain CR or LF characters. Regular code reviews and penetration testing can
  help to identify and mitigate such issues.
