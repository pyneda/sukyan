code: csrf
title: Cross-Site Request Forgery Detected
description: The application appears to be vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery
  (CSRF) attacks. This vulnerability occurs when the application allows an attacker
  to trick an authenticated user into performing an unwanted action without their
  consent. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to carry out actions with the
  same permissions as the victim, potentially leading to unauthorized data access,
  data loss, or account compromise.
remediation: To mitigate this vulnerability, ensure that the application uses anti-CSRF
  tokens in every form or state changing request. These tokens should be tied to a
  user's session and included in every form or AJAX request that might result in a
  change of state for the user's data or settings. Also, make sure the application
  checks for the presence and correctness of this token before processing any such
  requests.
