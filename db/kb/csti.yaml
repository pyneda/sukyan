title: Client-Side Template Injection
description: The application appears to be vulnerable to Client-Side Template Injection (CSTI). This vulnerability occurs when an attacker manipulates client-side templating engines by injecting malicious content into templates. Such actions can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and other client-side vulnerabilities. This typically arises from the application dynamically inserting untrusted data into templates without adequate sanitization or validation.
remediation: To mitigate CSTI vulnerabilities, ensure all user input is thoroughly sanitized before being processed by client-side templating engines. Employ Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to lessen the impact of any successful injections. Opt for templating libraries that automatically handle encoding and escaping of user-supplied data. Regularly perform code audits to identify and secure potential injection points.
