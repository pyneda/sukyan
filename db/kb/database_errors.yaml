title: Database Errors Detected
description:
  The application exposes database errors, which can leak sensitive information
  about the database setup and potentially the structure of the underlying data model.
  This could be valuable information for an attacker looking to exploit the application.
remediation:
  Avoid exposing database errors publicly. Consider implementing a global
  exception handler that can catch any unhandled exceptions and return a generic error
  message to the user. Detailed error information should be logged for debugging,
  but should not be exposed to the user or over insecure channels. Regular code reviews
  and penetration testing can help to identify and mitigate such issues.
