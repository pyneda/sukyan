title: Database Management Interface Detected
description: |
  A database management interface has been detected. While the presence of these interfaces 
  alone does not indicate a vulnerability, they should be reviewed to ensure they are:
  
  1. Intentionally exposed
  2. Properly secured
  3. Necessary in the current environment
  
  This finding requires manual verification to determine if it poses any security risk.

remediation: |
  If this interface is intentionally exposed:
  - Verify it requires proper authentication
  - Ensure access is restricted to necessary users/IPs
  - Confirm HTTPS is enabled if accessible from the internet

  If this interface is not meant to be exposed, remove it from the production environment and/or restrict access using firewall rules
