title: Docker API Detected
description: |
  A Docker API endpoint has been detected. The severity and impact of this finding depends on:
  
  - The level of access available (authenticated/unauthenticated)
  - The exposed API endpoints and their functionality
  - Whether the access is read-only or allows modifications
  - The configuration of the Docker daemon
  
  Potential exposure through this API could include:
  - Container management capabilities
  - Host system information
  - Container filesystem access
  - Container environment variables
  - Network configuration details
  - Image and volume information
  - Resource usage metrics
  
  Manual review is recommended to determine the exact access level and potential security impact.
  The presence of an exposed Docker API does not automatically indicate a critical vulnerability,
  but should be thoroughly investigated.
remediation: |
  Review the exposed Docker API:
  - Verify if authentication is properly configured
  - Review network access controls
  - Ensure TLS is properly implemented
  - Audit exposed functionality and information
  - Consider restricting to localhost if remote access is not required
