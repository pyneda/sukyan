title: DOM Storage Events Detection Report
description: This report identifies the detection of DOM Storage events on a specific page of the application.
  DOM Storage, including LocalStorage and SessionStorage, allows websites to store data in the user's browser.
  Monitoring these storage events can provide insights into how data is stored and managed by the application,
  which may indicate potential security concerns or privacy issues if sensitive data is handled improperly.
remediation: No specific remediation steps are required as this report serves purely informational purposes. However,
  it is recommended to review the usage of DOM Storage to ensure that sensitive information is not being
  stored insecurely or without proper encryption. Regular audits and compliance checks should be conducted
  to ensure that data storage practices adhere to relevant data protection standards and regulations.
