title: ASP.NET ELMAH Handler Exposed
description: |
  An exposed ASP.NET ELMAH (Error Logging Modules and Handlers) interface has been detected.
  This debug interface reveals detailed error information including stack traces, server variables,
  and application state. When accessible, it can expose sensitive technical details about the
  application's internal structure and runtime state that could aid in crafting attacks.
remediation: |
  1. Restrict access to ELMAH through proper authentication
  2. Move error logging to a secure location
  3. Use secure logging alternatives in production
  4. Review logs for sensitive data exposure
  5. Implement secure error handling
