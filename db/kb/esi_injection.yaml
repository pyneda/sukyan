title: Edge Side Includes (ESI) Injection
description:
  The application does not properly sanitize user input, potentially allowing
  for Edge Side Includes (ESI) injection attacks. This can be exploited to
  perform actions such as Server Side Request Forgeries (SSRF) or disclose
  sensitive information.
remediation:
  Ensure all user-supplied input is properly sanitized before being processed
  by the application. Avoid dynamically constructing ESI tags based on user input.
