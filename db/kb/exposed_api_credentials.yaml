code: exposed_api_credentials
title: Exposed API Credentials Detected
description: The application appears to have API credentials exposed. This vulnerability
  occurs when API keys, tokens or other forms of credentials are unintentionally exposed
  within the application, which could allow an attacker to misuse these credentials
  to gain unauthorized access or perform actions on behalf of the application.
remediation: To mitigate this vulnerability, ensure that API credentials are securely
  stored and not embedded in the code directly. Environment variables or secure credential
  storage should be used. Make sure to not commit these credentials in the version
  control system. If these exposed credentials have been used, consider them compromised
  and replace them immediately.
