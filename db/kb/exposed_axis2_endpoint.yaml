title: Exposed Apache Axis2 Service/Admin Interface
description: |
  An exposed Apache Axis2 endpoint was discovered. Axis2 is a web services/SOAP framework, and its administrative 
  interfaces and service endpoints can reveal sensitive information about the application's web services. 
  When exposed, these endpoints may allow:

  - Enumeration of all available web services
  - Access to service descriptions and WSDLs
  - View of system configuration details
  - Access to administrative functions
  - Potential manipulation of service configurations
  - Information disclosure about the internal service structure
remediation: |
  1. Remove or disable Axis2 admin interface in production
  2. If admin interface is required:
     - Restrict access by IP
     - Implement strong authentication
     - Ensure strong credentials are used
  3. Configure service security:
     - Enable WS-Security where needed
     - Restrict WSDL access to authenticated users
     - Remove detailed error messages
