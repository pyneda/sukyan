title: Exposed Rust Cargo Manifest
description: |
  A Rust Cargo manifest file (Cargo.toml) is publicly accessible. This file defines the application's Rust crate dependencies and project metadata.

  Exposed information may include:
  - All crate dependencies and features
  - Build and development dependencies
  - Package metadata and authors
  - Private crate registry configurations
  - Build configuration and target settings

  This information reveals dependency versions which could be cross-referenced with known vulnerability databases.

  Prevent public access to Cargo manifest files:
  - Configure web server to block access to Cargo.toml and Cargo.lock
  - Ensure these files are not deployed to public directories
  - Use server configuration to deny access
