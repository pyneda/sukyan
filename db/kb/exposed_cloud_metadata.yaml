title: Cloud Instance Metadata Service Endpoint Detected
description: |
  The application exposes a cloud instance metadata service endpoint. Instance metadata services provide 
  information about cloud instances including instance identifiers, network configuration, and potentially 
  sensitive data or credentials. Access to these endpoints should be carefully reviewed as exposure could 
  lead to information disclosure or, in cases where credentials are exposed, facilitate unauthorized access 
  to cloud resources.
remediation: |
  Configure network security controls to restrict access to metadata service endpoints. This may include 
  firewall rules, network security groups, or proxy configurations. Additionally, ensure the latest 
  metadata service version is in use as newer versions provide improved security controls.
