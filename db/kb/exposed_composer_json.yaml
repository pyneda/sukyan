title: Exposed PHP Composer Manifest
description: |
  A PHP Composer manifest file (composer.json) is publicly accessible. This file contains the application's PHP package dependencies and project configuration.

  Exposed information may include:
  - All Composer package dependencies and version constraints
  - Autoload configuration revealing class structures
  - Development dependencies and tooling
  - Private/internal package names
  - PSR-4 namespace mappings

  This information reveals dependency versions which could be cross-referenced with known vulnerability databases, and internal package names that may be susceptible to dependency confusion attacks.
remediation: |
  Prevent public access to Composer manifest files:
  - Configure web server to block access to composer.json and composer.lock
  - Move Composer files outside the web root
  - Use .htaccess or nginx rules to deny access to these files
  - Ensure deployment processes don't expose these files
