title: Exposed Ruby Gemfile
description: |
  A Ruby Gemfile is publicly accessible. This file defines the application's gem dependencies and their version constraints.

  Exposed information may include:
  - All Ruby gem dependencies
  - Development and test group dependencies
  - Gem sources and git repositories
  - Internal or private gem names
  - Version constraints and platform specifications

  This information reveals dependency versions which could be cross-referenced with known vulnerability databases, and private gem names that may be susceptible to dependency confusion attacks.
remediation: |
  Prevent public access to Gemfile and Gemfile.lock:
  - Configure web server to block access to these files
  - Move these files outside the web root
  - Use server configuration to deny access
  - Ensure deployment processes exclude these files from public directories
