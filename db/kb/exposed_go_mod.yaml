title: Exposed Go Modules File
description: |
  A Go modules file (go.mod) is publicly accessible. This file defines the application's Go module dependencies and version requirements.

  Exposed information may include:
  - All Go module dependencies
  - Module path revealing project structure
  - Version constraints and replacements
  - Private module paths
  - Indirect dependencies

  This information reveals dependency versions which could be cross-referenced with known vulnerability databases, and private module paths that may indicate internal infrastructure.

  Prevent public access to Go module files:
  - Configure web server to block access to go.mod and go.sum
  - Ensure these files are not copied to public directories during deployment
  - Use server configuration to deny access to these paths
