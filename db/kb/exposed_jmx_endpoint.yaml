title: Exposed HTTP JMX Endpoint (Jolokia)
description: |
  An exposed HTTP JMX endpoint (likely Jolokia) was discovered. Jolokia is a JMX-HTTP bridge that provides 
  REST-like access to JMX MBeans, exposing detailed information about the Java application's internals. 
  When exposed, these endpoints allow access to sensitive runtime information and potentially dangerous 
  operations.

  Access to these endpoints could reveal:
  - Memory usage and system properties
  - Thread and class loading information
  - Runtime configuration values
  - Application metrics and internal state
  - Application server details
remediation: |
  1. If Jolokia is not required, disable it completely
  2. If needed, implement proper access controls:
     - Restrict access to trusted IPs only
     - Enable authentication
     - Configure CORS properly
  3. Use Spring Security or similar to protect the endpoints
  4. Review and restrict accessible MBean operations
