title: Exposed Log File Detected
description: |
  The application exposes log files that are publicly accessible. Log files often contain sensitive information that could aid attackers in compromising the system, such as:
  
  - Stack traces revealing application structure and technology details
  - Internal system paths and configurations
  - Debug information and error messages
  - API keys, credentials, or session tokens
  - User data or business logic details
  - Database queries or backend system information
  
  The actual severity of this finding depends on the contents of the exposed logs and requires manual review to determine the full impact.
remediation: |
  1. Move log files outside of the web root directory
  2. Configure web server rules to block access to log files and directories
  3. Implement proper authentication for any logging endpoints
  4. Review log contents to ensure sensitive data is not being logged
