title: Exposed Node.js Package Manifest
description: |
  A Node.js package manifest file (package.json) is publicly accessible. This file contains metadata about the application's npm dependencies, development dependencies, and project configuration.

  Exposed information may include:
  - All npm package dependencies and their version constraints
  - Development and build tool configurations
  - Project metadata (name, version, author)
  - npm scripts and commands
  - Internal package names that may be susceptible to dependency confusion attacks

  This information reveals dependency versions which could be cross-referenced with known vulnerability databases.

  Prevent public access to package manifest files:
  - Configure web server to block access to package.json, package-lock.json, and similar files
  - Use .htaccess rules or nginx location blocks to deny access
  - Ensure build processes don't copy these files to public directories
  - Review CI/CD pipelines to prevent accidental exposure
