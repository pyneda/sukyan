title: Exposed Maven POM File
description: |
  A Maven Project Object Model (pom.xml) file is publicly accessible. This file defines the Java/Maven project's dependencies, build configuration, and metadata.

  Exposed information may include:
  - All Maven dependencies and their versions
  - Plugin configurations
  - Repository URLs including private repositories
  - Build profiles and properties
  - Parent POM references

  This information reveals dependency versions which could be cross-referenced with known vulnerability databases, and may expose private repository URLs.

  Prevent public access to Maven configuration files:
  - Configure web server to block access to pom.xml
  - Ensure build files are not deployed to public directories
  - Use .htaccess or server configuration to deny access
  - Review deployment pipelines to exclude build configuration files
