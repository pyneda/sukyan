title: Exposed Python Requirements File
description: |
  A Python requirements file (requirements.txt) is publicly accessible. This file lists the application's Python package dependencies.

  Exposed information may include:
  - All Python package dependencies
  - Exact version pins or version ranges
  - Private PyPI package names
  - Development and testing dependencies
  - Links to internal package indexes

  This information reveals dependency versions which could be cross-referenced with known vulnerability databases, and private package names that may be susceptible to dependency confusion attacks.
remediation: |
  Prevent public access to Python dependency files:
  - Configure web server to block access to requirements.txt, Pipfile, and pyproject.toml
  - Move these files outside the web root
  - Use .htaccess or nginx rules to deny access
  - Ensure deployment processes don't copy these files to public directories
