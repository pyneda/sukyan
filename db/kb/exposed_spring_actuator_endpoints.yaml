title: Exposed Spring Boot Actuator Endpoints
description: |
  Spring Boot Actuator endpoints have been detected on the application. These endpoints expose sensitive 
  operational information and functionality about the application, including environment variables, 
  configuration settings, health metrics, and potentially confidential system details. 
  
  The exposed endpoints may reveal:
  - Environment variables and system properties
  - Application configuration details
  - Database credentials and connection strings
  - Third-party service configurations
  - Application health and metrics
  - Thread dumps and heap information
  - Internal dependency information
  - Logging configurations

  This information could be leveraged by attackers to gather intelligence about the application,
  manipulate its behavior, or gain unauthorized access to sensitive information.
remediation: |
  To secure the application:
  - Disable all non-essential actuator endpoints
  - Move actuator endpoints to a separate management port
  - Implement strict access controls and authentication for actuator endpoints
  - Configure appropriate network-level restrictions
  - Review and monitor actuator endpoint access logs
