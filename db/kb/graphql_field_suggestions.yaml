title: GraphQL Field Suggestions Enabled
description: |-
  The GraphQL endpoint provides field suggestions in error messages when an invalid
  field is requested. This feature aids in schema enumeration even when introspection
  is disabled.

  When enabled, error responses may contain suggestions like "Did you mean 'password'?"
  which can help attackers discover valid field names without access to the schema.
remediation: |-
  Disable field suggestions in production environments. Most GraphQL servers allow
  configuring this behavior:
  - Apollo Server: Set fieldSuggestion: false in formatError
  - GraphQL-Java: Customize error handling to remove suggestions
  - Express-GraphQL: Use custom error formatter

  Ensure error messages in production only contain generic information.
