title: GraphQL Endpoint Detected
description: |
  A GraphQL API endpoint has been identified in the application. While GraphQL itself is not a security vulnerability, 
  its presence warrants attention as GraphQL endpoints can potentially expose excessive data or functionality if not 
  properly secured. GraphQL APIs may be vulnerable to issues such as information disclosure through introspection, 
  resource exhaustion through nested queries, or insufficient access controls.
remediation: |
  To secure the GraphQL endpoint:
  1. Disable introspection in production unless explicitly required
  2. Implement query depth limiting to prevent recursive query attacks
  3. Add appropriate rate limiting and timeout mechanisms
  4. Ensure proper authentication and authorization controls are in place
  5. Validate all input parameters
  6. Consider implementing persisted queries to restrict allowed operations
  7. Monitor and log GraphQL operations for suspicious patterns
  8. Use query cost analysis to prevent resource exhaustion
