title: HTTP-based gRPC Endpoint Detected
description: |
  A gRPC endpoint exposed over HTTP has been identified in the application. This includes either gRPC-Web (HTTP/1.1) 
  or standard gRPC over HTTP/2. While exposing gRPC services over HTTP allows for broader client compatibility, especially 
  with web browsers via gRPC-Web, these endpoints should be reviewed as they may provide access to sensitive API 
  functionality or service metadata through reflection capabilities.
remediation: |
  To secure the HTTP-exposed gRPC endpoint:
  1. Disable reflection service in production unless explicitly required
  2. Implement proper authentication and authorization
  3. Use TLS for all gRPC communications
  4. Configure appropriate CORS policies if using gRPC-Web
  5. Implement rate limiting and timeout mechanisms
  6. Monitor and log gRPC operations
  7. Consider using a API gateway for additional security controls
  8. Disable health checking endpoints in production if not needed
  9. Review and restrict exposed services and methods
