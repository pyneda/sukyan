title: Host Header Injection
description:
  The application appears to be vulnerable to Host Header Injection. This vulnerability occurs when
  a user is able to manipulate the Host header and the application trusts the header without proper
  validation. This can lead to vulnerabilities such as web cache poisoning, password reset poisoning, and malicious redirections.
remediation:
  To mitigate this vulnerability, validate and sanitize incoming Host headers. Use a whitelist of
  allowed domains and hostnames. Ensure that the application generates absolute URLs using a known
  good base URL, rather than relying on the incoming Host header. Additionally, implement proper
  logging of incorrect Host header attempts and regularly review for suspicious activities.
