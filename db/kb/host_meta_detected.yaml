title: Host-Meta File Detected
description: |
  A host-meta file has been discovered. This file follows RFC 6415 for host metadata discovery, providing information about services available at the host.

  The file may contain:
  - Link relations for WebFinger, OAuth, and other services
  - Service discovery endpoints
  - Authentication provider information
  - Federation configuration

  This is commonly used for decentralized identity and federation protocols.
remediation: |
  Review the host-meta file to ensure:
  - All listed services are intentionally exposed
  - Link relations point to valid, secure endpoints
  - Authentication endpoints use HTTPS
  - The file doesn't expose internal service configurations
