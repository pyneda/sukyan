title: HTTP/2 Protocol in Use
description:
  The application has been detected using the HTTP/2 protocol. While HTTP/2 provides significant benefits in performance and features, like header compression, multiplexing, and prioritization, it's not without some HTTP/2 specific vulnerabilities such as certain request smuggling techniques.
remediation:
  Ensure that the server appropriately announces its support for HTTP/2 and that the HTTP/2 implementation adheres to best practices. Keep server software or supporting libraries updated to receive the latest security patches.
