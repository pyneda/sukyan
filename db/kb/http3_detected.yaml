title: HTTP/3 Protocol in Use
description:
  The application is utilizing the HTTP/3 protocol. HTTP/3, the successor to HTTP/2, offers performance enhancements and operates over the QUIC transport protocol, which aims to improve upon the shortcomings of TCP. This includes benefits like reduced latency and better congestion control. However, as with any protocol, incorrect implementations or configurations can introduce vulnerabilities specific to HTTP/3 and QUIC.
remediation:
  Ensure the server signals its support for HTTP/3 correctly and that the HTTP/3 and QUIC implementations align with best practices. Regularly update server software or libraries that handle HTTP/3 to incorporate the latest security improvements.
