title: HTTP Method Override Accepted
description: |-
  The application accepts HTTP method override headers, allowing the actual HTTP
  method to be changed via headers or query parameters. This can potentially be
  used to bypass method-based access controls.

  Common override mechanisms:
  - X-HTTP-Method-Override header
  - X-Method-Override header
  - _method query parameter

  For example, a GET request with X-HTTP-Method-Override: DELETE might be
  processed as a DELETE request, bypassing security controls that only check
  the actual HTTP method.
remediation: |-
  Disable HTTP method override functionality in production unless absolutely required.
  If method override is needed:
  - Implement strict validation of the original method
  - Apply the same authorization checks regardless of override
  - Log method override usage for security monitoring
  - Consider restricting which methods can be overridden
