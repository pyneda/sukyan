title: HTTP Request Smuggling (CL.0)
description:
  The application is vulnerable to HTTP request smuggling via Content-Length
  zero edge case handling. In this CL.0 variant, the back-end server ignores or
  mishandles the Content-Length header, treating request body data as the start
  of a new request. This can occur when servers have different behaviors for
  handling requests where Content-Length does not match actual body length.
  An attacker can exploit this to smuggle malicious requests, bypass security
  controls, or hijack other users' requests.
remediation:
  Configure all servers in the chain to strictly validate Content-Length headers.
  Reject requests where Content-Length does not match actual body length. Ensure
  connection reuse policies are consistent across all servers. Use HTTP/2 end-to-end
  where possible. Consider using a web application firewall (WAF) with request
  smuggling detection capabilities.
