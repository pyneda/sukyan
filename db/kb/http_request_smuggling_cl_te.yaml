title: HTTP Request Smuggling (CL.TE)
description:
  The application is vulnerable to HTTP request smuggling via Content-Length and
  Transfer-Encoding header manipulation. In this CL.TE variant, the front-end server
  uses the Content-Length header while the back-end server uses the Transfer-Encoding
  header. An attacker can exploit this desynchronization to smuggle malicious requests,
  potentially bypassing security controls, poisoning caches, or hijacking other users'
  requests.
remediation:
  Configure all servers in the chain to use the same method for determining request
  boundaries. Disable chunked transfer encoding if not required. Use HTTP/2 end-to-end
  where possible. Implement strict request validation and normalize requests before
  processing. Consider using a web application firewall (WAF) with request smuggling
  detection capabilities. Ensure front-end and back-end servers are patched and
  configured consistently.
