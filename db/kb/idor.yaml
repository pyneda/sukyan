code: idor
title: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) Detected
description:
  The application appears to be vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR).
  This vulnerability occurs when an attacker can access or modify objects (e.g., database records,
  files) directly by manipulating input parameters, such as URLs or form fields, without proper
  authorization checks. IDOR can lead to unauthorized data disclosure, data tampering, or other
  unintended actions.
remediation:
  To mitigate this vulnerability, implement proper access controls for all application objects.
  Ensure that each request for a specific object is accompanied by an authorization check to determine
  if the user has the necessary permissions to access or modify the object. Use indirect references,
  like session-based mappings, instead of direct object references in URLs or form fields. Regularly
  review application logs for suspicious activity and conduct thorough testing to identify potential
  IDOR vulnerabilities.
