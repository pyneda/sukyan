title: Incorrect Content Type Header
description: The application does not correctly specify the content type of the response,
  potentially leading to security vulnerabilities such as MIME sniffing attacks.
remediation: 'Always specify a correct ''Content-Type'' header in the response. Use
  ''X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff'' to prevent the browser from MIME-sniffing a
  response away from the declared content-type.'
