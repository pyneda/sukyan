title: IndexedDB Usage Detection Report
description: This report highlights the usage of IndexedDB on specific pages of the application.
  IndexedDB is a low-level API for client-side storage of significant amounts of structured data,
  including files/blobs. This allows web applications to store data persistently in a user's browser,
  and to function efficiently without an internet connection. Monitoring IndexedDB usage can provide
  insights into the application's data storage capabilities and potential areas where sensitive data
  might be stored or exposed.
remediation: No specific remediation steps are required as this report is intended for informational purposes only.
  It is advisable for developers and security teams to ensure that IndexedDB is used securely and
  in compliance with data protection standards. Data stored using IndexedDB should be encrypted if it
  contains sensitive or personal information. Regular security reviews and audits should be performed
  to validate data handling practices and to mitigate potential exposure risks.
