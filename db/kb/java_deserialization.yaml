code: java_deserialization
title: Insecure Java Deserialization Detected
description:
  The application appears to be vulnerable to insecure Java deserialization attacks.
  This vulnerability arises when an application deserializes untrusted data without
  proper validation. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary
  code, bypass authentication, or perform other malicious activities.
remediation:
  To mitigate this vulnerability, avoid deserializing untrusted data.
  Use safe serialization libraries or frameworks that do not allow the execution
  of arbitrary code. Implement strong type-checking during deserialization and
  apply the principle of least privilege. Regularly update and patch Java libraries 
  to protect against known deserialization exploits.
