code: java_server_header
title: Java Version Detected
description: The application's server response header discloses the version of Java
  in use. This could potentially provide valuable information to an attacker seeking
  to exploit a known vulnerability in the disclosed Java version.
remediation: Configure your server to not disclose software version information in
  its response headers. Alternatively, ensure your software versions are regularly
  updated to the latest versions, mitigating the risk of known vulnerabilities.
