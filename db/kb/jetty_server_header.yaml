title: Jetty Version Detected
description:
  The application's server response header discloses the version of Jetty
  in use. An attacker can exploit this information to target known vulnerabilities
  in the disclosed Jetty version.
remediation:
  Configure your server to not disclose software version information in
  its response headers. Alternatively, regularly update your Jetty version to the
  latest one to reduce the risk of known vulnerabilities.
