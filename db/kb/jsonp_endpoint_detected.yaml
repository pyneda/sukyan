title: JSONP Endpoint Detected
description: |
  The application implements JSONP (JSON with Padding) functionality, which allows the response data to be wrapped in a 
  caller-specified callback function. While JSONP is a legitimate technique for bypassing the Same-Origin Policy to enable 
  cross-origin data sharing, it can lead to security issues if not properly implemented. An attacker could potentially 
  exploit JSONP endpoints to steal sensitive data by making the victim's browser request the JSONP endpoint with a 
  specially crafted callback function.
remediation: |
  JSONP is inherently designed to bypass Same-Origin Policy restrictions, making it fundamentally unsuitable for endpoints 
  that handle sensitive data. The primary recommendation is to avoid using JSONP for any sensitive operations or data access.

  If the endpoint must remain accessible cross-origin:
  1. Consider replacing JSONP with CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing), which provides better security controls
  2. If JSONP must be maintained:
     - Implement strict callback name validation using a whitelist of allowed function names
     - Add proper authentication checks to prevent unauthorized access
     - Set appropriate Cache-Control headers to prevent response caching
     - Consider implementing token-based protection against CSRF attacks
  3. Evaluate if the endpoint really needs to be accessible cross-origin
  4. Document all JSONP endpoints and regularly review their necessity and security
