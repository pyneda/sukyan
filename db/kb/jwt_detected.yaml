title: JSON Web Token (JWT) Detected
description:
  The application appears to use JSON Web Tokens (JWT). If not properly
  secured, JWTs can lead to various security issues, including token-based authentication
  vulnerabilities and identity spoofing.
remediation:
  Ensure that JWTs are used securely. Implement proper validation and handling
  mechanisms. Consider using additional safeguards such as Token Binding, and never
  expose sensitive information in the payload of the JWT. Always verify the signature
  of incoming JWTs to confirm they were issued by your system.
