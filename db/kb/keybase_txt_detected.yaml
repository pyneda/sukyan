title: Keybase Proof File Detected
description: |
  A Keybase verification file has been discovered. This file is used to cryptographically prove ownership of the domain on the Keybase identity platform.

  The file contains:
  - Keybase username
  - Cryptographic signature
  - Domain ownership proof

  This indicates the domain owner has verified their identity through Keybase. Note that Keybase was acquired by Zoom in 2020 and active development has slowed, though existing proofs remain functional.
remediation: |
  Review the Keybase proof to ensure:
  - The linked Keybase account is still controlled by the domain owner
  - The proof is still valid and intended
  - Consider if this identity verification should remain public
  - Evaluate if the proof is still relevant given Keybase's reduced activity
