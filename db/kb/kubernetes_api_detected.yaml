title: Kubernetes API Detected
description: |
  A Kubernetes API endpoint has been detected. The severity and impact of this finding depends on:
  
  - The level of access available (authenticated/unauthenticated)
  - The exposed API endpoints and their functionality
  - Whether the access is read-only or allows modifications
  - The sensitivity of exposed information
  
  Potential information exposure could include:
  - Pod and container details
  - Service configurations
  - Node information
  - Cluster configuration details
  - Internal network architecture
  
  Manual review is recommended to determine the exact access level and potential security impact.
remediation: |
  Review the exposed Kubernetes API:
  - Verify if authentication is properly configured
  - Ensure RBAC policies are implemented
  - Configure network policies appropriately
  - Review exposed information and functionality
