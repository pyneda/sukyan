title: Missing Content Type Header
description:
  The application does not appear to be setting a content type in the response
  headers. This can lead to security vulnerabilities if the browser attempts to 'sniff'
  the MIME type, potentially leading to situations where content is interpreted and
  executed as a different type than intended. For example, an attacker might be able
  to trick a user's browser into interpreting a response body as HTML or JavaScript,
  leading to cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.
remediation:
  "To mitigate this vulnerability, ensure that all responses include a
  Content-Type header that accurately reflects the type of content being returned.
  If the content type is not known in advance, 'application/octet-stream' can be
  used as a general fallback. Avoid using 'text/plain' as this can still be sniffed
  in some situations. In addition, setting the 'X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff'
  header will instruct the browser not to attempt to sniff the MIME type."
