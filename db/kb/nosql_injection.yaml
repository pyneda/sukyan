title: NoSQL Injection Detected
description:
  The application appears to be vulnerable to NoSQL injection attacks.
  This vulnerability occurs when the application uses user-supplied input to construct
  NoSQL queries without properly sanitizing or validating the input first. An attacker
  can exploit this vulnerability to manipulate queries, potentially leading to unauthorized
  data access, data loss, or data corruption.
remediation:
  To mitigate this vulnerability, avoid constructing queries with user-supplied
  input whenever possible. Instead, use parameterized queries, which can help ensure
  that user input is not interpreted as part of the query. Implement proper input
  validation and sanitization procedures. Also, ensure that the least privilege principle
  is followed, and each function of the application has only the necessary access
  rights it needs to perform its tasks.
