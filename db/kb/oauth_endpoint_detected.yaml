title: OAuth/OpenID Configuration Endpoint Detected
description: |
  An OAuth or OpenID Connect configuration endpoint was discovered. These endpoints 
  provide information about the OAuth/OIDC implementation, including authorization 
  endpoints, token endpoints, and supported features. This finding requires manual 
  review to determine if sensitive information is inappropriately exposed.
remediation: |
  Review the exposed OAuth/OIDC endpoints to ensure they only disclose necessary 
  information for client operation. Consider restricting access to any configuration 
  endpoints that aren't required for normal OAuth flows.
