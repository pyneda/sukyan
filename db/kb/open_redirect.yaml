code: open_redirect
title: Open Redirect
description:
  The application appears to be vulnerable to open redirect attacks. This vulnerability
  occurs when an application accepts untrusted input that can cause the web application
  to redirect the request to a URL contained within untrusted input. This can be used
  in phishing attacks to redirect users to malicious sites.
remediation:
  Ensure that all redirection URLs are validated against a white-list of trusted URLs.
  Avoid using user-supplied input to determine the destination of redirection without 
  validation. If user input is utilized, ensure it is properly sanitized and validated
  against expected inputs.
