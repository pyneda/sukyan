code: parameter_pollution
title: Parameter Pollution Detected
description:
  The application appears to be vulnerable to Parameter Pollution. This vulnerability
  occurs when the application does not properly validate or handle multiple instances
  of the same parameter. An attacker can exploit this by injecting additional parameters
  or by manipulating existing ones, potentially leading to a variety of impacts such as
  bypassing input validation, manipulating application logic, or accessing unauthorized data.
remediation:
  Ensure that the application properly handles, validates, and sanitizes all parameters.
  Implement strict rules for processing incoming parameters and reject any requests with 
  unexpected or repeated parameters. Regularly review application logic to ensure consistent
  handling of parameters throughout the application.
