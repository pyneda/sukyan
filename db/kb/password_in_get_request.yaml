code: password_in_get_request
title: Password Submitted in GET Request
description: "The application allows users to submit passwords using the GET method in URLs,
  which poses a significant security risk. Passwords transmitted in URLs are easily
  exposed in browser history, server logs, and can be intercepted by attackers. This
  vulnerability could lead to unauthorized access to user accounts and compromise
  sensitive information."
remediation: "To mitigate this vulnerability, never use the GET method to transmit sensitive data,
  including passwords. Use the POST method with HTTPS to ensure that data is not
  exposed in URLs and is encrypted during transmission. Additionally, review and
  sanitize server logs to prevent storing sensitive information and enforce strict
  guidelines for handling sensitive data transmission securely."
