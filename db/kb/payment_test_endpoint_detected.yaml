title: Payment System Test Endpoint Detected
description: |
  A payment system test endpoint has been discovered. These endpoints are typically used for testing payment 
  integrations and may expose test credentials, sandbox configurations, or payment system debugging interfaces. 
  While test endpoints often use sandbox credentials, they might reveal information about the payment system 
  architecture or in some cases contain misconfigured production credentials.
remediation: |
  Restrict access to payment test endpoints in production environments. Move test endpoints to separate 
  testing environments and ensure proper access controls are in place. Review exposed endpoints for sensitive 
  information and verify that no production credentials are exposed.
