title: Perl Code Injection
description: The application allows the execution of arbitrary Perl code through user input.
remediation:
  Avoid using eval(), do(), require() with user input, and other dynamic code 
  execution functions. Use proper input validation and sanitization. Consider 
  using safer alternatives like Safe.pm for restricted evaluation or predefined 
  subroutine mappings instead of dynamic code execution.
