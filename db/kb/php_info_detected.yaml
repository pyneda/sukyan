title: PHPInfo Page Detected
description: |
  A PHPInfo page was discovered on the server. The phpinfo() function outputs sensitive 
  information about PHP's configuration including installed modules, server settings, 
  paths, environment variables and configuration options. This information can be used 
  by attackers to identify vulnerabilities and plan targeted attacks.
remediation: |
  Remove or disable access to any files containing phpinfo() function calls from 
  production environments. If needed for debugging, ensure these files are only 
  accessible in development environments or protected by appropriate authentication.
