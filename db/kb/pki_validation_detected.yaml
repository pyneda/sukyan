title: PKI Validation Directory Detected
description: |
  A PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) validation directory is accessible. This directory is typically used by certificate authorities for domain control validation when issuing SSL/TLS certificates.

  The presence of this directory indicates:
  - SSL/TLS certificate management on the domain
  - Potential validation files from certificate authorities
  - Infrastructure for certificate issuance

  Stale validation files may remain from previous certificate requests.
remediation: |
  Review the PKI validation configuration:
  - Remove old validation files after certificate issuance
  - Ensure the directory doesn't contain sensitive information
  - Consider restricting access after validation is complete
  - Monitor for unexpected files in this directory
