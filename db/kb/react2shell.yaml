title: React Server Components Pre-Auth RCE (React2Shell)
description: >
  A pre-authentication remote code execution vulnerability exists in React Server
  Components versions 19.0.0 through 19.2.0. The vulnerable code unsafely deserializes
  payloads from HTTP requests to Server Function endpoints, allowing attackers to
  execute arbitrary JavaScript on the server. This affects applications using React
  Server Components, including Next.js with the App Router.

  Affected packages include react-server-dom-parcel, react-server-dom-turbopack, and
  react-server-dom-webpack.
remediation: >
  Update React to version 19.2.1 or later. Review your Next.js application to ensure
  you are using the latest patched versions of all React Server Components packages.
