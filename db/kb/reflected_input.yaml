code: "reflected_input"
title: "Input reflected in response"
description: "Input reflection arises when data originating from a user request is directly echoed back in the application's immediate response. While not inherently a vulnerability, it serves as a crucial step for several client-side vulnerabilities abd certain server-side vulnerabilities like SQL injection become more discernible and exploitable when input is echoed back in responses."
remediation: "To avoid vulnerabilities raised due to input returned in response, implement robust input validation and output encoding mechanisms. Ensure that user-supplied data is thoroughly sanitized and validated before being echoed back in application responses. Employ context-aware encoding techniques to prevent various types of injection attacks and security misconfigurations."
