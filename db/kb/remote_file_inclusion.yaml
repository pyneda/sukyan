code: remote_file_inclusion
title: Remote File Inclusion Detected
description: The application appears to be vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion (RFI)
  attacks. This vulnerability occurs when the application uses user-supplied input
  to include remote files without properly sanitizing or validating the input first.
  An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to inject malicious scripts, potentially
  leading to unauthorized data access, data corruption, or even server takeover.
remediation: To mitigate this vulnerability, avoid including files from remote servers
  whenever possible. When it is necessary to do so, ensure that the remote file's
  location is hard-coded or otherwise not influenced by user input. Also, implement
  proper input validation and sanitization procedures. Regular code reviews and penetration
  testing can help to identify and mitigate such issues.
