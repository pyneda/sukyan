title: Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) Detected
description: |
  A Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) file has been discovered. An SBOM is a detailed inventory of all components, libraries, and dependencies used in the application.

  The SBOM may contain:
  - Complete list of software components
  - Version information for all dependencies
  - License information
  - Supplier and origin data
  - Known vulnerability associations

  Publishing SBOMs is increasingly encouraged by regulatory bodies (including CISA and the US Executive Order 14028) for supply chain transparency. Many organizations intentionally make SBOMs publicly available.

  Review SBOM publication practices:
  - Verify if public SBOM access is intentional per organizational policy
  - If unintentional, restrict access or remove from public directories
  - Ensure the SBOM does not contain internal or proprietary component names that were not intended for disclosure
  - Use SBOMs as part of your vulnerability management program
  - Consider documenting your SBOM publication policy
