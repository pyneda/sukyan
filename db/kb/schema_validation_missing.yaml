title: Schema Validation Missing
description: |-
  The API endpoint does not properly validate input against its defined schema constraints. When testing with values that violate the API specification (such as values outside defined min/max bounds, strings exceeding length limits, or values not matching required patterns), the server accepted the request instead of rejecting it.

  This indicates that the server-side validation does not match the API specification, which can lead to:
  - Data integrity issues when invalid data is stored
  - Business logic bypass when constraints are not enforced
  - Potential security vulnerabilities if malformed input reaches backend systems
  - Inconsistency between documented API behavior and actual implementation

  Missing schema validation is particularly concerning for:
  - Numeric bounds (min/max values)
  - String length constraints
  - Pattern/regex validation
  - Enum value restrictions
  - Required field enforcement
remediation: |-
  Implement comprehensive server-side validation that enforces all schema constraints defined in the API specification:

  1. Validate all input parameters against their defined types and constraints
  2. Ensure numeric values respect min/max bounds
  3. Enforce string length limits (minLength/maxLength)
  4. Apply pattern validation for formatted fields (email, UUID, etc.)
  5. Restrict values to defined enum lists where applicable
  6. Return appropriate 400 Bad Request responses for invalid input
  7. Never rely solely on client-side validation

  Consider using validation libraries that can automatically enforce OpenAPI/JSON Schema constraints.
