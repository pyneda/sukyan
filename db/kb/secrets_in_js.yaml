title: Exposed Secrets in Javascript
description: The application appears to contain sensitive data, such as API keys,
  passwords or cryptographic keys, directly within the JavaScript code. This exposure
  can lead to critical vulnerabilities as it provides potential attackers with sensitive
  details that can be used to exploit the application or other related systems.
remediation: To mitigate this issue, never hard-code secrets into your JavaScript
  or any other client-side code. Instead, store secrets server-side and ensure they
  are securely transmitted and only to authenticated and authorized entities. Implement
  strict access controls and consider using secret management solutions. Regular code
  reviews can help to identify and remove any accidentally committed secrets.
