title: Exposed Secrets in JSON Response
description:
  The application returns sensitive data, such as API keys,
  passwords or cryptographic keys, within a JSON API response. This exposure
  can lead to critical vulnerabilities as it provides potential attackers with sensitive
  details that can be used to exploit the application or other related systems.
remediation:
  To mitigate this issue, never include secrets in JSON responses
  served to clients. Store secrets server-side and ensure they
  are securely transmitted and only to authenticated and authorized entities. Implement
  strict access controls and consider using secret management solutions. Regular code
  reviews can help to identify and remove any accidentally exposed secrets.
