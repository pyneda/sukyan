title: Server-Side Prototype Pollution Detected
description:
  The application appears to be vulnerable to Server-Side Prototype Pollution
  (SSPP) attacks. This vulnerability occurs when the application allows modification
  of a JavaScript object prototype. When a function traverses the entire prototype
  chain, an attacker can inject properties into this chain, potentially leading to
  various impacts, such as denial-of-service, property overwrite, or even remote code
  execution if the polluted properties are used unsafely.
remediation:
  To mitigate this vulnerability, avoid using user-supplied input in the
  object manipulation functions without proper validation. Validate and sanitize the
  inputs that are used for configuration. Be aware of the libraries or dependencies
  that your application uses and keep them updated. Regular code reviews and penetration
  testing can also help to identify and mitigate such issues.
