title: Session Token In WebSocket Message
description:
  The application includes session tokens or authentication data in WebSocket
  messages, which may be logged or intercepted. While WebSocket connections
  can be secure, sensitive authentication data should be handled carefully.
remediation:
  Consider using connection-level authentication (via headers during handshake)
  rather than sending tokens in message payloads. If tokens must be sent in
  messages, ensure proper encryption and avoid logging sensitive data.
