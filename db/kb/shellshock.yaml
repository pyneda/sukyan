title: Shellshock (CVE-2014-6271) Vulnerability
description:
  The application appears to be vulnerable to Shellshock (CVE-2014-6271), a critical
  vulnerability in GNU Bash that allows remote code execution. The vulnerability
  exists in how Bash processes trailing strings after function definitions in
  environment variables. When user-controllable input (such as HTTP headers like
  User-Agent, Referer, or Cookie) is passed to a CGI script or other server-side
  component that invokes Bash, an attacker can inject and execute arbitrary commands.
  This vulnerability affects Bash versions through 4.3 and was disclosed in September 2014.
remediation:
  Update GNU Bash to a patched version (4.3 patch 25 or later, or apply
  vendor-specific patches). Identify all systems running vulnerable Bash versions
  using vulnerability scanners. Review CGI scripts and other components that may
  invoke shell commands with user-controlled input. Consider using alternative
  shells or avoiding shell invocation where possible. Implement Web Application
  Firewalls (WAF) with rules to detect Shellshock payloads as a defense-in-depth
  measure.
