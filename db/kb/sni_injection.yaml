title: Server Name Indication (SNI) Injection
description:
  The application is vulnerable to Server Name Indication (SNI) Injection.
  This vulnerability occurs when the application does not validate or incorrectly
  processes the SNI during the TLS handshake process. An attacker can exploit this
  to inject arbitrary data, induce abnormal behavior in applications, or conduct Server-Side
  Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks.
remediation:
  Properly validate and sanitize the SNI during the TLS handshake process.
  Consider implementing additional security measures such as input validation, parameterized
  queries, or appropriate encoding to prevent injection attacks. Be wary of how your
  application handles SNI, especially if you are using a Web Application Server (WAS)
  or Ingress.
