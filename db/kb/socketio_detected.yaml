title: Socket.IO Endpoint Detected
description: |
  A Socket.IO endpoint was discovered. Socket.IO is a JavaScript library that enables 
  real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication between web clients and servers. 
  The presence of Socket.IO endpoints should be reviewed to ensure proper security 
  controls are in place.
remediation: |
  Review the Socket.IO implementation to ensure appropriate security controls are 
  implemented and that access is restricted to authorized users only.
