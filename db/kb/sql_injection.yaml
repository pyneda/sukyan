title: SQL Injection Detected
description:
  The application appears to be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. This
  vulnerability occurs when the application uses user-supplied input to construct
  SQL queries without properly sanitizing or validating the input first. An attacker
  can exploit this vulnerability to manipulate queries, potentially leading to unauthorized
  data access, data loss, or data corruption.
remediation:
  To mitigate this vulnerability, avoid constructing SQL queries with user-supplied
  input whenever possible. Instead, use parameterized queries or prepared statements,
  which can help ensure that user input is not interpreted as part of the SQL command.
  Implement proper input validation and sanitization procedures. Also, ensure that
  the least privilege principle is followed, and each function of the application
  has only the necessary access rights it needs to perform its tasks.
