title: Server Side Includes (SSI) Injection
description:
  The application does not properly sanitize user input, potentially allowing
  for Server Side Includes (SSI) injection attacks. This can be exploited to
  execute server-side commands or disclose sensitive information.
remediation:
  Ensure all user-supplied input is properly sanitized before being processed
  by the application. Avoid dynamically constructing SSI directives based on user input.
