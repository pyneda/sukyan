title: SSO/SAML Metadata Endpoint Detected
description: |
  A Single Sign-On (SSO) metadata endpoint was discovered. These endpoints typically 
  contain SAML configuration details used for establishing federation between service 
  providers and identity providers. While this information is often necessary for SSO 
  operation, the exposed metadata should be reviewed to ensure it doesn't disclose 
  unnecessary internal details.
remediation: |
  Review the exposed SSO metadata to verify it only contains the minimum information 
  required for federation. Consider implementing access controls if the metadata 
  contains sensitive internal endpoints or certificates that aren't required by 
  identity providers.
