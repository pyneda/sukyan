title: Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) Detected
description:
  The application appears to be vulnerable to Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI).
  This vulnerability occurs when an attacker can inject arbitrary template code into 
  a template engine, resulting in unintended code execution on the server. Exploiting 
  this vulnerability could allow attackers to execute arbitrary commands, read sensitive 
  server-side files, or perform other malicious actions.
remediation:
  To mitigate this vulnerability, ensure that user inputs are strictly sanitized before 
  being passed to a template engine. Avoid using raw user input within templates without 
  validation or sanitization. Implement strict input validation mechanisms and consider 
  using safer template systems or configurations that restrict the capabilities of templates.
