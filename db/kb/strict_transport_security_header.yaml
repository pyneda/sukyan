description:
  The application's HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) policy is misconfigured,
  potentially leading to man-in-the-middle attacks.
remediation:
  Configure your application's headers to properly set the HSTS policy,
  including 'max-age' and optionally 'includeSubDomains' and 'preload'.
