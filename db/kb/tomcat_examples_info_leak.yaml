title: Apache Tomcat Example Scripts Information Leakage
description: |
  The application server appears to expose Apache Tomcat example scripts that were not removed from the production environment. 
  These example scripts that come with Apache Tomcat v4.x - v7.x can be used by attackers to gain sensitive information about 
  the system, including server configuration, system properties, and environment details. Additionally, these scripts are known 
  to be vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) injection attacks.

  The presence of these example scripts indicates improper server hardening and could provide attackers with valuable 
  information for further attacks.
remediation: |
  To fix this vulnerability:
  1. Remove all example scripts and documentation from production Tomcat installations
  2. If examples are needed for development, maintain them only in development environments
  3. Follow Tomcat security hardening guides to properly configure production servers
  4. Consider implementing security filters or URL rewriting rules to block access to /examples/ directories
  5. Regularly audit web server configurations to ensure no test/example content is exposed
