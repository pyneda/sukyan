code: unencrypted_password_submission
title: Unencrypted Password Submission Detected
description:
  "The application allows users to submit passwords over an unencrypted connection (HTTP),
  which poses a significant security risk. Passwords transmitted over HTTP are sent
  in plain text and can be intercepted by attackers monitoring network traffic. This
  vulnerability could lead to unauthorized access to user accounts and compromise
  sensitive information."
remediation:
  "To mitigate this vulnerability, ensure that all sensitive data, including passwords,
  is transmitted over a secure connection (HTTPS). Implement SSL/TLS encryption to
  protect data in transit and prevent eavesdropping. Additionally, enforce HTTPS
  redirection to automatically redirect users from HTTP to HTTPS to ensure secure
  communication. Regularly audit network configurations and monitor for any
  insecure communication channels."
