code: unencrypted_websocket_connection
title: Unencrypted WebSocket Connection Detected
description: 
  "The application establishes a WebSocket connection over an unencrypted connection (ws://),
  which poses a significant security risk. Data transmitted over unencrypted WebSocket connections
  can be intercepted by attackers monitoring network traffic, potentially leading to unauthorized access
  to sensitive information. This vulnerability could compromise the confidentiality and integrity of the data
  exchanged between the client and server."
remediation: 
  "To mitigate this vulnerability, ensure that all WebSocket connections are established over a secure connection (wss://).
  Implement SSL/TLS encryption to protect data in transit and prevent eavesdropping. Additionally, review and update
  WebSocket connection configurations to enforce secure communication and regularly audit the network for any insecure
  WebSocket endpoints."
