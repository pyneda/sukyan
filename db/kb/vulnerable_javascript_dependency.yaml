title: Vulnerable JavaScript Dependency
description:
  The application appears to be using a version of a JavaScript library
  which is known to be vulnerable. Using out-of-date libraries can expose the application
  to security risks, as vulnerabilities in the code may be exploited by an attacker.
remediation:
  Upgrade the vulnerable library to the latest version or to the minimum
  secure version. Ensure all other libraries and dependencies are also up-to-date
  to prevent similar issues. Regular dependency checks and vulnerability scanning
  can help keep your application secure.
