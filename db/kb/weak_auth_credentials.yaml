title: Weak Authentication Credentials
description:
  The application uses authentication mechanisms with weak, easily guessable credentials. Through brute force attack, the authentication credentials were successfully compromised, allowing unauthorized access to protected resources. Weak credentials pose a significant security risk regardless of the authentication method used, as they can be easily discovered by attackers using dictionary attacks or brute force techniques.
remediation:
  Implement strong password policies requiring complex passwords with minimum length, uppercase/lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) where possible. Implement account lockout mechanisms after failed login attempts and rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks. Consider implementing additional security measures like CAPTCHA after multiple failed attempts. Monitor authentication logs for suspicious activity and failed login attempts. Regularly audit user accounts for weak passwords and enforce password changes.
