title: Weak Basic Authentication Credentials
description:
  The application uses HTTP Basic Authentication with weak, easily guessable credentials. Through brute force attack, the authentication credentials were successfully compromised, allowing unauthorized access to protected resources. Basic Authentication transmits credentials in a base64-encoded format, making it particularly vulnerable when weak passwords are used.
remediation:
  Implement strong password policies requiring complex passwords with minimum length, uppercase/lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) where possible. Implement account lockout mechanisms after failed login attempts and rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks. Consider replacing Basic Authentication with more secure methods like OAuth 2.0, JWT, or API keys. Monitor authentication logs for suspicious activity and failed login attempts.
