title: Weak Digest Authentication Credentials
description:
  The application uses HTTP Digest Authentication with weak, easily guessable credentials. Through brute force attack, the authentication credentials were successfully compromised, allowing unauthorized access to protected resources. While Digest Authentication is more secure than Basic Authentication as it uses cryptographic hashing, weak passwords still make it vulnerable to dictionary and brute force attacks.
remediation:
  Implement strong password policies requiring complex passwords with minimum length, uppercase/lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) where possible. Implement account lockout mechanisms after failed login attempts and rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks. Ensure proper nonce management to prevent replay attacks. Consider replacing Digest Authentication with more modern secure methods like OAuth 2.0, JWT, or certificate-based authentication. Monitor authentication logs for suspicious activity and failed login attempts.
