title: WebAssembly (Wasm) Detection
description:
  The application appears to use WebAssembly (Wasm), a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. WebAssembly is designed for efficient and secure execution of code on the web, enabling high-performance applications. However, improper management of WebAssembly can introduce security risks.
remediation:
  Ensure that the WebAssembly modules are sourced from trusted origins.
  Regularly audit and update WebAssembly modules to patch any vulnerabilities.
  Implement appropriate Content Security Policies (CSP) to restrict WebAssembly execution.
  Monitor and log WebAssembly usage to detect any anomalous activities.
