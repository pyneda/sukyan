title: Web Server Access Control File Exposed
description: |
  A web server access control file (.htaccess, .htpasswd, or similar) has been found exposed.
  These files contain sensitive server configuration details that may include URL rewriting rules,
  authentication settings, directory restrictions, and custom handlers. Access to these files can
  reveal implementation details and security mechanisms that could aid an attacker in
  compromising the system.
remediation: |
  1. Configure your web server to deny access to control files
  2. Use appropriate filesystem permissions on configuration files
  3. Move sensitive configurations to the main server configuration where possible
  4. Remove any unnecessary backup copies of configuration files
  5. Implement monitoring for unauthorized access attempts
