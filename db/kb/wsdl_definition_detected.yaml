title: WSDL Definition Detected
description: |
  A WSDL (Web Services Description Language) endpoint has been identified in the application. While WSDL itself is not 
  inherently a security vulnerability, its presence warrants attention as WSDL files often contain detailed information 
  about web service operations, data structures, and endpoints. This information could potentially be leveraged by 
  attackers to understand the API surface and identify potential attack vectors.
remediation: |
  To secure the WSDL endpoint:
  1. Consider whether public WSDL exposure is necessary
  2. Implement authentication for WSDL access if possible
  3. Remove any sensitive information from service descriptions
  4. Use WSDL hiding techniques in production environments
  5. Implement proper access controls on the actual service endpoints
  6. Consider using WS-Security for sensitive operations
  7. Monitor and log access to WSDL endpoints
  8. Ensure error messages don't reveal internal details
  9. Consider using a service gateway to control WSDL access
