title: WSDL File Publicly Accessible
description: |-
  The WSDL (Web Services Description Language) file is publicly accessible. This
  file describes the complete structure of the SOAP web service including all
  operations, parameters, data types, and endpoint locations.

  The exposed WSDL provides attackers with:
  - Complete list of available operations
  - Parameter names and types for each operation
  - Data structure definitions
  - Security binding information
  - Endpoint URLs
remediation: |-
  Consider restricting access to WSDL files in production:
  - Require authentication to access the WSDL
  - Use IP-based access controls to limit WSDL access
  - Disable automatic WSDL generation (?wsdl parameter)
  - Host WSDL files in a separate, protected location

  If WSDL must be public, ensure all documented operations are:
  - Properly authenticated
  - Authorized based on user roles
  - Protected against common attacks
