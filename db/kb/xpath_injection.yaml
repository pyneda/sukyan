title: XPath Injection Detected
description:
  The application appears to be vulnerable to XPath injection attacks.
  This vulnerability occurs when the application uses user-supplied input to construct
  XPath queries without properly sanitizing or validating the input first. An attacker
  can exploit this vulnerability to manipulate queries, potentially leading to unauthorized
  data access, data loss, or data corruption.
remediation:
  To mitigate this vulnerability, avoid constructing XPath queries with
  user-supplied input whenever possible. Instead, use parameterized queries or prepared
  statements, which can help ensure that user input is not interpreted as part of
  the XPath command. Implement proper input validation and sanitization procedures.
  Also, ensure that the least privilege principle is followed, and each function of
  the application has only the necessary access rights it needs to perform its tasks.
