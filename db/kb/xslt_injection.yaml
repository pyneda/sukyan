code: xslt_injection
title: XSLT Injection
description:
  The application does not properly sanitize user input before processing it
  with XSLT. This can lead to arbitrary code execution, data extraction, or
  other unintended behaviors when malicious XSLT content is processed.
remediation:
  Ensure all user-supplied input is thoroughly sanitized and validated before
  being used in XSLT processing. Avoid dynamically constructing XSLT based on
  user input. If dynamic construction is required, use a safe method for combining
  XSLT, such as parameterized templates.
