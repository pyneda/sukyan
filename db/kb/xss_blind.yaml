title: Blind XSS
description:
  The application appears to be vulnerable to Blind Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
  This vulnerability occurs when user-supplied input is stored and later executed in a
  different context than where it was originally submitted, often in administrative
  interfaces or areas not immediately visible to the attacker. Unlike reflected XSS,
  blind XSS payloads execute asynchronously and are typically detected through
  out-of-band techniques such as DNS lookups, HTTP requests, or JavaScript callbacks.
  This type of XSS can be particularly dangerous as it may execute in privileged
  contexts such as admin panels, allowing attackers to perform actions with elevated
  privileges or steal sensitive information from high-privilege users.
remediation:
  To mitigate this vulnerability, implement comprehensive input validation and output
  encoding for all user-supplied data, regardless of where it will be displayed.
  Ensure proper sanitization occurs both on input and output. Implement Content
  Security Policy (CSP) headers that restrict script execution and external resource
  loading. Use context-aware output encoding based on where the data will be displayed
  (HTML, JavaScript, CSS, etc.). Regularly audit and test all user input fields,
  including those that may be displayed in administrative interfaces or log files.
  Consider implementing monitoring for unusual outbound network requests that could
  indicate XSS payload execution.
