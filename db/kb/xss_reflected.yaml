code: xss_reflected
title: Reflected XSS
description:
  The application appears to be vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
  This vulnerability occurs when user-supplied input is incorporated into web pages without
  proper sanitization and is then returned to the user in the web page. An attacker can exploit
  this by crafting malicious links containing script code which executes in the victim's browser
  when clicked, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data theft, or malicious actions on
  behalf of the user.
remediation:
  To mitigate this vulnerability, ensure all user-supplied input is encoded or escaped before
  being included in output. Implement content security policies that restrict the sources of
  executable scripts. Use frameworks that automatically handle these encodings. Validate and
  sanitize all user input to remove or encode potentially dangerous characters. Regularly
  update and review web applications for XSS vulnerabilities.
