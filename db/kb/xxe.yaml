title: XML External Entity (XXE) Detected
description:
  The application appears to be vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks. This vulnerability
  occurs when an application processes XML input containing a reference to an external entity. It
  can lead to disclosure of internal files, internal port scanning, remote code execution, and denial
  of service attacks.
remediation:
  Disable the processing of external entities in your XML parser. Ensure that any XML parsing libraries
  or frameworks used by the application are configured securely. Regularly update and patch XML libraries 
  to protect against known XXE exploits. If possible, use JSON or other data formats instead of XML.
