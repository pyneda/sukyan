Plan a migration strategy to modern web technologies:\n   - Replace ActiveX controls with standard HTML5 elements and JavaScript\n   - Use modern APIs for file operations and system interactions\n   - Implement secure alternatives for any custom functionality\n   - Consider Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) for advanced features\n   - Use WebAssembly for performance-critical components\n3. Remove all ActiveX-related code including:\n   - Object/Embed tags with ClassIDs\n   - ActiveXObject JavaScript calls\n   - .cab and .ocx files\n4. Update any documentation that references ActiveX functionality\n5. Implement user notifications about technology changes if necessary\n6.

Unlike reflected XSS, the malicious payload never reaches the server, making it harder to detect with traditional security measures. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or malicious actions performed on behalf of the user.",
		Remediation: "To mitigate DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities, avoid using dangerous sink functions like innerHTML, document.write(), and eval() when handling user-controllable data. Instead, use safer alternatives such as textContent for setting text content, or DOM manipulation methods like createElement and appendChild for adding elements. If you must use dangerous sinks, sanitize all input from sources like location.hash, location.search, document.referrer, localStorage, and window.name using a trusted library such as DOMPurify. Implement a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) to limit the impact of XSS attacks. Use the URL API for parsing URLs instead of string manipulation.

Outdated installations, vulnerable plugins or themes, and misconfigurations can expose the application to various security risks.\n\nPotential risks include:\n- Exposure to known vulnerabilities due to outdated core, plugins, or themes\n- Brute-force attacks on login pages\n- Unauthorized access to sensitive files or administrative functionalities\n- Common web vulnerabilities like XSS, SQL Injection, and CSRF\n\nManual review is recommended to determine the exact security posture and any potential vulnerabilities.\n",
		Remediation: "Review the WordPress installation:\n- Update WordPress core, themes, and plugins to their latest versions.\n- Remove any unused or deprecated plugins and themes.\n- Implement security best practices, such as:\n  - Using strong, unique passwords for all user accounts\n  - Limiting login attempts and implementing CAPTCHA\n  - Enabling two-factor authentication (2FA)\n  - Installing reputable security plugins (e.g., Wordfence, Sucuri)\n- Restrict access to sensitive files and directories (e.g., `wp-config.php`, `.htaccess`).\n- Disable directory listing on the web server.\n- Regularly monitor and audit for suspicious activities or changes.\n",

		Description: "A WSDL (Web Services Description Language) endpoint has been identified in the application. While WSDL itself is not \ninherently a security vulnerability, its presence warrants attention as WSDL files often contain detailed information \nabout web service operations, data structures, and endpoints. This information could potentially be leveraged by \nattackers to understand the API surface and identify potential attack vectors.\n",
		Remediation: "To secure the WSDL endpoint:\n1. Consider whether public WSDL exposure is necessary\n2. Implement authentication for WSDL access if possible\n3. Remove any sensitive information from service descriptions\n4. Use WSDL hiding techniques in production environments\n5. Implement proper access controls on the actual service endpoints\n6. Consider using WS-Security for sensitive operations\n7. Monitor and log access to WSDL endpoints\n8. Ensure error messages don't reveal internal details\n9. Consider using a service gateway to control WSDL access\n",

		Description: "The application appears to be vulnerable to Blind Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This vulnerability occurs when user-supplied input is stored and later executed in a different context than where it was originally submitted, often in administrative interfaces or areas not immediately visible to the attacker. Unlike reflected XSS, blind XSS payloads execute asynchronously and are typically detected through out-of-band techniques such as DNS lookups, HTTP requests, or JavaScript callbacks. This type of XSS can be particularly dangerous as it may execute in privileged contexts such as admin panels, allowing attackers to perform actions with elevated privileges or steal sensitive information from high-privilege users.",
		Remediation: "To mitigate this vulnerability, implement comprehensive input validation and output encoding for all user-supplied data, regardless of where it will be displayed. Ensure proper sanitization occurs both on input and output. Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers that restrict script execution and external resource loading. Use context-aware output encoding based on where the data will be displayed (HTML, JavaScript, CSS, etc.). Regularly audit and test all user input fields, including those that may be displayed in administrative interfaces or log files. Consider implementing monitoring for unusual outbound network requests that could indicate XSS payload execution.",

This vulnerability occurs when user-supplied input is incorporated into web pages without proper sanitization and is then returned to the user in the web page. An attacker can exploit this by crafting malicious links containing script code which executes in the victim's browser when clicked, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data theft, or malicious actions on behalf of the user.",
		Remediation: "To mitigate this vulnerability, ensure all user-supplied input is encoded or escaped before being included in output. Implement content security policies that restrict the sources of executable scripts. Use frameworks that automatically handle these encodings.
