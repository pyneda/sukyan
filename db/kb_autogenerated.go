These controls had extensive\naccess to the Windows operating system and were a common attack vector for malware.\nWith Internet Explorer's end-of-life on June 15, 2022, continued use of ActiveX\ncreates both security vulnerabilities and severe functionality issues.\n",
		Remediation: "To address this security concern:\n1. Identify all ActiveX controls and functionality in your application\n2. Plan a migration strategy to modern web technologies:\n   - Replace ActiveX controls with standard HTML5 elements and JavaScript\n   - Use modern APIs for file operations and system interactions\n   - Implement secure alternatives for any custom functionality\n   - Consider Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) for advanced features\n   - Use WebAssembly for performance-critical components\n3. Remove all ActiveX-related code including:\n   - Object/Embed tags with ClassIDs\n   - ActiveXObject JavaScript calls\n   - .cab and .ocx files\n4. Update any documentation that references ActiveX functionality\n5. Implement user notifications about technology changes if necessary\n6.
